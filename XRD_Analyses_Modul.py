Modul with the different functions needed for the XRD analyses jupyter notebook
it contains:

Functions:
__________

json_data_read_reduce: 
function to read in XRD data as jason file with can be downloaded from materialsproject

peak: 
function that calculates the lattice constance for bcc metals and alloys from the peak position, here for W and Cr

relevant: 
filters the peak position which are condsideren in the callulation of the peak fuction above

irrelevant: 
filters all peaks, which were not considered above for the oxids peaks

ox_index: 
searchsorted based functions that compares two arrays, in a uncertanty interval and gives back the index of values from the array one which fit to array two with in the uncertanty. This makes it possible to filter only the fitting peaks to the litereature data.

plane_count: 
gives information about the number of alloy peaks and their distribution. This helps to find the optimal number of bins for the sorting of alloy peaks in to different concentrations.
